# LTSpiceThemer
An easy to use GUI to change the theme of LTSpice circuit simulator.

My goal with this was to create a simple tool to tweak the themes of the LTSpice simulator so that I could use screenshots to make nice looking presentations.

As it may be useful for others, I am making the binary and code available with MIT license.

I hope you find it useful too :D.
